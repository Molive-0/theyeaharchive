        Miiverse was a social network for the Nintendo 3DS and WiiU that was run by Nintendo - it
        closed down in 2017. In Miiverse you could like posts using the "Yeah!" button, which came
        in four styles based on the mood of your account at the time.
        Also included is a high quality recreation of the Miiverse Yeah button, seen often on X
        (formerly Twitter)
