# The Yeah! Archive
A public repository and archive of Miiverse "Yeah!" reaction images

## Huh? What's this then?
In 2024 the musky odour that was floating around the formerly twitter offices was getting pretty bad. For an undisclosed reason that everyone probably knows about, the abilitiy to see what someone liked disappeared.
There was uproar. Rage. Many angry tweets. But then, a ray of hope in the darkness: The Miiverse "Yeah!" button.

People started posting the "Yeah!" button under tweets to signify that they liked that tweet in a way that others could see. Very quickly, people started making lots of additions and modifications - different colours, different icons, different text. Negative ones, not sure ones - every person had their own personal "Yeah!" button.

This is happening really quickly, right now - and I'm worried that this will be here and gone in a flash. So, here is The Yeah! Archive, a public repository of all the "Yeah!" buttons that appeared this year. It's meant as a project to archive internet history - I believe that if we don't save this now it will be lost. Oh, and also you can use these to post under tweets :)

## How can I help?
If you find a "Yeah!" button that is not here yet, create a pull request to add it in. If you are unsure on how to make pull requests, don't worry: send it to this gmail account and I will try and add it personally: "theyeaharchive@...". By submitting the image in either way you agree to licence the image under the same license as the whole repository: [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
Please add images in the same way as you see other images being added so far: create a folder with an appropriate name, place the images inside, and then fill out "description.xml" and place that in there too. There is a description.xml template for you to use.

## What kind of things should be added?
Anything! Go wild. Submissions should be a remix of the miiverse button, by itself, in the highest quality possible. Do not add images that are deliberately low quality and full of JPEG artifacts, they can be added later to the high quality images if needed. NSFW entries are not allowed. Even if you think that the button you have is not consequential, please add it.
